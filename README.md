# Awesome Deep Learning Study Group

> Format of this is hugely inspired by [jwasham/coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)

__Contributions are welcome, so please open a PR if you can improve this list or something is missing!__

## What is it?

This is a big study list for deep learning, croudsourced by the [Deep Learning Study Group at Discord](#study-group-invite).
You can start this with or without programming skills. With or without math and/or linear algebra skills.

By the end of this study guide you should:

- Understand how deep learning models function and the intuition behind them
- Have acquired knowledge of the popular and best-performing neural network architectures
- Be able to make deep learning models from scratch

## Study group invite

For an invite to the study group discord, write to [Oliver Klingefjord on Twitter]("https://twitter.com/klingfjord") or use the following link: https://discord.gg/4KY7M3N

## Why use it?

It's hard to learn deep learning. It's even harder to find out exactly what you need to study in the internet. There are so many courses available. So many resources. This is a hand-made curated list, designed to ultimately save you time and make learning efficient. We try hard to make sure that there are no missing pieces and that anybody can follow through this guide.

## How to use it

Everything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom, skipping items you feel you possess sufficient knowledge about.

## Don't feel you aren't smart enough

- Successful software engineers are smart, but many have an insecurity that they aren't smart enough.

## Before you Get Started

### You can't take it all in at once

Take breaks, write down possible things you need to re-review and watch them later or in a different way. This is a lot to take in and breaks are mandatory.

Some concepts can take much longer to understand fully. So if you don't understand it immediately do not worry. I suggest re-studying some of the parts that seemed hard to you after doing one pass on this study list.

### Focus

There are a lot of distractions that can take up valuable time. Focus and concentration are hard.

## What you won't see covered

- To be determined towards study-guide completion

## Programming Prerequisite Knowledge

### For the non-programmer

### For the programmer

From this point on, you are considered a fully functional programmer. Hurray!

## Math Prerequisite Knowledge

### For the non-mathematician

### For the one that is comfortable with some calculus or linear algebra

From this point on, you are considered a fully functional mathematician. Hurray! Time to get into Deep Learning.

## Deep Learning Basics

The basic building blocks of deep learning systems. The theory, the methodology, practise and common tricks used.

## Common Neural Networks

This section will go over deep learning building blocks and networks that are milestones in the research world. This is the most useful sub-list a beginner should get familiar with. These common tasks include but are not limited to: computer vision, natural language processing and time series tasks.

## Hands On Guides

It's time to make some stuff. After a small ecosystem and libraries review, let's get started with the technology of your choice.

## More Exotic Deep Learning

Different data formats, specialized hardware and exotic network architectures.

## Other Interesting

Lastly, I hope that enjoyed reading and learning from this simple text file as much as I enjoyed researching and writing about it.
